# June 16th: Decided on using RP2354A!

I looked at the datasheet to decide which chip to use.
I chose a "A" chip as i don't need the amount of pins found on the "B" chips
Later on i decided on a rp2354a I chose a "4" as the use case of the chip shouldn't need more than the onboard storage so to save space i am using on-chip flash
