# The PiKey (Formerly called the RPKey)

This is a project that was created as yubikeys cost a great deal for something that i would use as a physical security key interfacing through usb-c.

When a Pico could be used using <a href="https://github.com/polhenarejos/pico-fido">Pico Fido</a>

But Picos are expensive and I could just learn to make one.
So that is what I did!
