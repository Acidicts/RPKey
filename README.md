# The PiKey (Formerly called the RPKey)

This is a project that was created as yubikeys cost a great deal for something that i would use as a physical security key interfacing through usb-c.

When a Pico could be used using <a href="https://github.com/polhenarejos/pico-fido">Pico Fido</a>

But Picos are expensive and I could just learn to make one.
So that is what I did!

<div style="display:flex; flex-direction:"row"">
  <img width="25%" alt="pcb" src="https://placehold.co/200x250" />
  <img width="70%" alt="schematic" src="https://placehold.co/400x160" />
</div>

<div style="display:flex; flex-direction:"row"">
