# The PiKey (Formerly called the RPKey)

This is a project that was created as yubikeys cost a great deal for something that i would use as a physical security key interfacing through usb-c.

When a Pico could be used using <a href="https://github.com/polhenarejos/pico-fido">Pico Fido</a>

But Picos are expensive and I could just learn to make one.
So that is what I did!

<div style="display:flex; flex-direction:"row">
  <img width="25%" alt="pcb" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ada8d68d-e0ae-4311-80f7-c94865b7aa63" />

</div>
